# TOPIC INTRO

## temptation to use stage as a personal megaphone
I considered using this talk to push my own philosophy of best practices, but thought it might be better
to share some of the most interesting tools we use at Meetup so you could decide for yourself how some of them
might be useful for your organization or development process.

## confessions of a sass hater
HEADLINE: "Sass won't fix this, let's focus on bigger problems"
- "Sass won't help you write better CSS; it creates an incentive to make the worst parts worse"
	- nesting
	- mixins duplicate rules, dissuade responsible one-to-many class definitions
	- mixins may also discourage smart element defaults


## warming up to sass
After 4 years...
- realization that sass is an indication of the maturity of our field
	- package management
	- optimization through pre-compilation
	- polyfills
	- variables
	- functions
	- calculations
- as long as you realize that at the end of the day Sass compiles into a declarative language, you're golden.

## what "future tools" means
We have more at our disposal than ever before (modern browsers, standards, the rise of github, etc).
This talk won't be covering new technologies in web development; it's about
the tools we can build right now to push our craft forward and hone the process
of making a product for the web.

# yes, meetup has a design team now
[oldthemes](https://docs.google.com/a/meetup.com/presentation/d/1d1l0ijsVgnhS9scNJzQXsYGP1ZB4JzMp0DTR08TQ3sw/edit#slide=id.gdd6f5325_320)
- without a design team, this was not only ugly, it lacked good UX design.
	- Allowing changes to text colors and background colors
		- color blind orgs made horrible pages for users with normal vision
		- orgs with normal vision made horrible pages for color blind users
- tl;dr, if there were a design team involved in the decision, one of meetup's biggest missteps may not have happened

## dark ages of design at meetup
- no central voice
- you could tell who built a page
- inconsistent brand
- inconsistent UI
- awful code
- making the users do our job
	- "the leadership team"

# (bad) workflow examples
TODO: chart of segmented, siloed development

# TOOL #1: (good) design-driven development with style foundations
TODO: chart of "design vocabulary/foundation" as the middle layer

# TOOL #2: style foundation
- "It's up to you how you want to define 'foundation' depending on your needs, but here's how we think of it at Meetup"
- why live style guides fail
	- overly specific "legos" (there's a tool to fix that)
	- documentation is hard to maintain (there's a tool to fix that)
	- we don't live in a web-only world anymore (there's a tool to fix that)
	- require cut-over rewrites (there's a tool to fix that)

# TOOL #3: document flow, rational css

---

# TOOL #4: Rothko, because native apps matter

---

# TOOL #5: The Cascade
Strangler vines!

- cascade is a thing
	- style ordering is an instruction, as much so as any style
	- that's why we don't have Sass path globbing; it's the same as the compiler throwing out code
	- use it with intent!
	- ... and it makes CSS the perfect candidate for strangling!
