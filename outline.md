# Topic introduction

## confessions of a sass hater
- "Sass won't help you write better CSS; it creates an incentive to make the worst parts worse"
	- nesting
	- mixins duplicate rules, dissuade responsible one-to-many class definitions
	- mixins may also discourage smart element defaults


## warming up to sass
- realization that sass is an indication of the maturity of our field
	- package management
	- optimization through pre-compilation
	- polyfills
	- variables
	- functions
	- calculations
- as long as you realize that at the end of the day Sass compiles into a declarative language, you're golden.

## what "future tools" means
We have more at our disposal than ever before (modern browsers, standards, the rise of github, etc).
This talk won't be covering new technologies in web development; it's about
the tools we can build right now to push our craft forward and hone the process
of making a product for the web.

# meetup has designers?
[oldthemes](https://docs.google.com/a/meetup.com/presentation/d/1d1l0ijsVgnhS9scNJzQXsYGP1ZB4JzMp0DTR08TQ3sw/edit#slide=id.gdd6f5325_320)

## dark ages of design at meetup
- no central voice
- you could tell who built a page
- inconsistent brand
- inconsistent UI
- awful code
- making the users do our job
	- themes
	- "the leadership team"

## new(ish) design team at meetup!
- maybe some photos
- also show communications team

---

# (bad) workflow examples
TODO: chart of segmented, siloed development

---

# (good) design-driven development
TODO: chart of "design foundation" as the middle layer

- "It's up to you how you want to define 'foundation' depending on your needs, but here's how we think of it at Meetup"

---

# colors (swatches)

---

# foundation (sassquatch)

# legacy CSS advantages
Strangler vines!

- cascade is a thing
	- style ordering is an instruction, as much so as any style
	- that's why we don't have Sass path globbing; it's the same as the compiler throwing out code
	- use it with intent!
	- ... and it makes CSS the perfect candidate for strangling!
